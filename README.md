# CSI-385-Project
Final Project for CSI-385

In this project, each group is required to construct a relational database system to handle a
specific task that mimics a reasonably complex read-world situation. All the important stages
that comprise the life cycle of a typical database project are organized sequentially as sections in
this project. Students are expected to gain working knowledge about how a nontrivial database
system is designed, validated, implemented and maintained. The organization of this project is as
follows.
- In Sections 1 to 3, the target domain problem is demonstrated, and the motivated
questions that will be answered by the proposed system are presented.
- In Sections 4 to 5, the target problem is modeled into a set of E/R diagrams, which is then
converted into the initial schema design.
- In Sections 6 to 12, the initial schema design is improved by identifying FDâ€™s and being
converted to the third normal forms (3NF). At the meantime, the skills of converting
questions that are expressed in plain English into compact mathematical formulas are
developed using relational algebra.
- In Sections 13 to 14, the final relational schema design is transformed into a database
system implementation. At the same time, the set of SQL queries are formed.
- In Sections 15 to 17, the implemented database system is put in the client-server
environment, and a typical client program that accesses the database system is
implemented. In addition, the database design is extended with more features that are in
turn tested in the client program again.

Mirror for design documents will be posted when they are finished
