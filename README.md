#Learning Objectives
In the process of completing this project, students will develop their abilities to:
- Specify, design, test and document the design of a file system, a key component of an operating
system.
- Use shared memory as a means of inter-process communication.

#Problem Statement
You will be working in a group of 2 members. As a team, you will design and implement the FAT12 file
system. Also, your team must design a test plan to evaluate your system as careful as possible. You will
test and debug the system according to your test plan. Finally, demonstrate your system using an image
of a floppy disk. Throughout the project, you will maintain current documentation of your design and
test plan. At the end of the project, you must submit a copy of your design and test plan.
